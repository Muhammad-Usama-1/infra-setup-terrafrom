Virtualization Technology

At the core of AWS EC2 is virtualization technology, which enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server. AWS uses a customized version of the Xen hypervisor, a type 1 hypervisor that runs directly on the host's hardware, to enable VMs to run on physical servers with high levels of isolation and security.

Here's how AWS authenticates PEM files:

During instance creation, AWS prompts the user to create or specify an existing key pair. This key pair consists of a public key that is stored on the EC2 instance and a private key file that is downloaded to the user's local machine in PEM format.

When the user wants to connect to the EC2 instance, they provide the private key file to their SSH client. The SSH client then uses the private key to authenticate the user to the EC2 instance.

When the user connects to the EC2 instance, AWS checks the public key stored on the instance against the public key derived from the private key file provided by the user. If the two keys match, the user is authenticated and granted access to the instance.

If the public keys do not match, AWS denies access to the instance and logs the attempt. This ensures that only authorized users can access the EC2 instance.

To enhance security, users can also configure additional security measures such as enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) or creating security groups that restrict access to specific IP addresses or ports.

In summary, AWS authenticates PEM files by comparing the public key stored on the EC2 instance with the public key derived from the private key file provided by the user. This ensures that only authorized users can access the EC2 instance and that sensitive data remains secure.

its mean sthat ssh converts pem file to public ?
Yes, that's correct. When a user connects to an EC2 instance using their private key file in PEM format, the SSH client uses the private key to generate a corresponding public key that is sent to the instance for authentication. The SSH client does this automatically as part of the connection process, without requiring any additional input from the user.

The public key generated by the SSH client is based on the cryptographic algorithm used by the private key, which is typically RSA or DSA. The public key is derived from the private key in such a way that it can only be authenticated by the corresponding private key, which is stored on the EC2 instance. This means that if the private key file is compromised, an attacker cannot generate a valid public key to authenticate themselves to the instance.

By using a public-private key pair for authentication, AWS EC2 provides a secure way for users to access their instances without the need for a password. This helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data and ensures that only authorized users with the correct private key can connect to the instance.

When a user wants to connect to an EC2 instance, they use an SSH client to initiate a secure connection to the instance. As part of the SSH protocol, the client and server exchange cryptographic keys to establish a secure communication channel.

In the case of AWS EC2 instances, the user provides their private key file in PEM format to the SSH client. The SSH client then uses this private key to generate a unique public key that is sent to the EC2 instance as part of the connection process.

On the EC2 instance, the SSH daemon receives the public key sent by the client and checks it against the public keys stored in the authorized_keys file, located in the /home/<user>/.ssh/ directory of the instance. If the received public key matches one of the public keys in the authorized_keys file, the user is authenticated and granted access to the instance.

The reason this works is that the private key and public key are mathematically related to each other in such a way that only the corresponding private key can decrypt data that was encrypted using the public key, and vice versa. This means that when the user provides their private key to the SSH client, the client can use it to generate a public key that can only be authenticated by the corresponding private key stored on the EC2 instance.

Overall, this process ensures that only authorized users with the correct private key can access the EC2 instance, and that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access.

why 400 permission reuires ?
The 400 permission is typically required for private key files to ensure that only the owner of the file has read access to it. This is important for security reasons, as the private key is used for authentication and can be used to gain access to sensitive systems or data.

Setting the permission of a file to 400 ensures that no other users on the system can read or modify the contents of the file, even if they have access to the file system. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to the private key and helps to keep the key secure.

In addition to setting the correct file permissions, it's also important to protect the private key by storing it in a secure location, such as an encrypted drive or a password-protected keychain. This can help to prevent the key from being stolen or compromised in the event of a security breach.
