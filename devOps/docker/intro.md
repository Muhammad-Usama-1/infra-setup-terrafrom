Docker in three paragraphs!!!

Docker is a tool that lets you run your applications inside "containers." A container is like a little computer inside your actual computer, and it has everything your application needs to run. This makes it really easy to run your application on any computer because you don't have to worry about setting up the right environment or installing dependencies.

To use Docker, you'll first need to install it on your computer. Then, you'll create a "Dockerfile" which tells Docker how to build your container. A Dockerfile is just a text file with a bunch of instructions, like what base image to use and what commands to run when the container starts.

Once you have a Dockerfile, you can build your container using the docker build command. Then, you can run your container using the docker run command. And that's it! Your application will be running inside a container, which means you can run it on any computer with Docker installed.
